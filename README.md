# UNP-Project_BI-with-Power-BI_Global-Covid-19

I completed this project as part of my BI with PowerBI internship with the United Network of Professionals (UNP).

About the data: The dataset used is a global COVID-19 dataset, encompassing information on cases, deaths, vaccinations, hospitalizations, and related metrics worldwide.

Transformation: Utilized Power BI for data transformations. Cleaned and filtered data to ensure accuracy. Merged tables to consolidate relevant information. Derived new columns to calculate rates (death rate, vaccination rate, hospitalization rate).

Calculated key metrics using DAX measures: Global Death Rate Total Vaccinations Vaccination Rate Hospitalization Rate Total Deaths Total Cases

Created a dynamic dashboard with: Line charts showcasing total cases and deaths over time. Slicers for region and time period selection. Bubble map illustrating deaths by continent. Bar chart displaying the top 5 countries by stringency index Bar chart highlighting the top 5 continents by the Human Development Index (HDI) Table summarizing figures by continent, including vaccination rate, death rate, total cases, and total deaths
